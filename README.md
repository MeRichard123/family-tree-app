# The Family Tree App

_The app that let's you generate a family tree!_

# Usage!

## Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Node JS installed

## To get started clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/MeRichard123/family-tree-app.git`

## Create A Virtual Environment:

I use the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) package, but feel free to use any you are comfortable with.

In Command Prompt:

- `cd family-tree-app\backend`
- Create: `virtualenv env`
- Activate Windows: `env\Script\activate`
- Activate Mac: `source bin\activate`

Once Activated you can install the necessary packages.

Install Python Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In a new terminal window install React Dependencies:

```
cd frontend
npm i
```

To run the react app run `npm start` in the frontend directory
